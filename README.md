# World_Weather_Analysis

# Project Summary
For this project, I have used multiple API's to complete analysis of weather across the world and how it can be used to identify ideal vacation cities along with routing directions between those cities.  

I started this analysis by using random latitudes and longitudes to give us random cities. From there, we were able to use a weather API and Google Maps API to gather the relevant data and create a map of all cities with their weather information.  

Once I had the weather information in the, I could then use that to narrow down all of the cities that fell within an ideal vacation temperature range.  This map was narrowed down from the original data set to only show those specific cities.

Lastly, I utilized the Direction Google Maps API to build upon the first 2 features.  This functionality allowed me to create driving directions between 4 cities that fell within the ideal temperature range.
